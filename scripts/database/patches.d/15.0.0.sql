-- The authentication is done group-wise now (not person-wise) because we assume that isp-caches can caches calls
-- better if there is no difference between them (even not in the headers).
-- This a has the nice side effect, that we can store group-labels here (and potentially validTo as well).
-- and keep them, even if the login is gone (wich was an old known problem before, but a lesser one, since labels don't
-- appear in the final data).
