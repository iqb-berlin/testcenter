# DOCKER IMAGE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# This section defines the Docker image configurations for various components 
# of the Testcenter application. For production deployments, it's recommended 
# to use specific image tags rather than 'stable' to ensure reproducible deployments.
# Configure image pull policies based on your deployment strategy
image:
  ## Image Registry Configuration
  # Configure your registry path based on your deployment environment:
  # - Docker Hub:       (aka registry-1.docker.io/) leave REGISTRY_PATH empty
  # - Docker Hub Proxy: scm.cms.hu-berlin.de:443/iqb/dependency_proxy/containers/
