# Testcenter Backend

This is the backend of the Testcenter application.  

You can find the frontend [here](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/testcenter-frontend).

The repository for a complete setup of the application can be found
[here](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/testcenter-setup).

## Documentation

Find API documentation [here](https://iqb-berlin.github.io/testcenter-backend/api/).

## Bug Reportsddd

File bug reports, feature requests etc. [here](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/testcenter-backend/issues).

## Installation

### With Docker

All the necessary commands for running the application and starting the tests
can be found in the Makefile on the root directory.

Alternatively you can download the container [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iqbberlin/testcenter-backend).

###### Start and Stop the server
```
make run
make stop
```

### Manual installation on Webserver

See [Manual Installation](https://iqb-berlin.github.io/testcenter-backend/manual_installation.html)

## Upgrade from previous versions

Find Changelog [here](https://iqb-berlin.github.io/testcenter-backend/UPGRADE.html)

## Development

### Using Composer for dependency management
For local development you can install and update dependencies via Composer (https://getcomposer.org/, 
https://hub.docker.com/_/composer/).

To read the composer.json file from the project base directory, resolve the dependencies, and install them into vendor 
directory (https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#install-i), use the following command:
```
make composer-install
```

To get the latest versions of the dependencies and to update the composer.lock file 
(https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#update-u), you should use*:
```
make composer-update
```
**For this to work you have to provide your github-oauth token in an 'auth.json' file at project base directory 
(https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md#github-oauth)*

### Running the tests
While the backend is running, do
```
make test-unit
make test-e2e
```

There are also special test for the init-script (aka the installer).
The run their own containers and therefore don't need `make run` before.
```
make test-init
```

### Coding Standards

Following mostly [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

Most important:
* Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps ([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/))
* Method names MUST be declared in camelCase ([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/))
* Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/))
* Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code. ([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/))
* Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects
(e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both. ([PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/))

#### Various Rules and hints

* Always put a white line below function signature and two above!
* Use typed function signature as of php 7.1, arrays can be used as type, but will be replaced by typed array classes
once 7.4 is default.
* Never `require` or `include` anywhere, program uses autoload for all classes from the `classes`-dir.
Exception: Unit-tests, where we want to define dependencies explicit in the test-file itself (and nowhere else).
* Always throw exceptions in case of error. They will be globally caught by ErrorHandler.
When you are in the situation of catching an exception anywhere else it's 99% better not to throw the exception
(since it's not an exception case most likely) but return false or null ot the like.
